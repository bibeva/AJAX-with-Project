  <p>AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique that allows web pages to fetch and update data from a server without reloading the page. It uses JavaScript to send HTTP requests and update the DOM dynamically. Modern applications use Fetch API or Axios instead of XMLHttpRequest for better flexibility. AJAX improves user experience by enabling real-time updates, like loading new content without refreshing the entire page.</p>
